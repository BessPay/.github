# BessPay GitHub Organisation

**Empowering cross-border payments and content monetisation for the Global South**

Welcome to the GitHub organisation for BessPay, where we build open-source projects to support our mission: making payments easier, cheaper and faster for creators, MSMEs and marketplaces in emerging markets.

---

## Who We Are

BessPay is a fintech company focused on enabling global payments for MSMEs and content creators, especially across the Global South. Our platform supports cross-border transactions, subscription models and integrates with marketplaces and local payment/cash-out systems.

- **Website**: [besspay.net](https://besspay.net/)
- **LinkedIn**: [BessPay Company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/besspay/)

We leverage the [Interledger Foundation (ILF)](https://interledger.org/) and Interledger Protocol ecosystem for secure, interoperable payments. Our goal is to reduce friction, lower costs and empower local creators and businesses to participate freely in global commerce.
